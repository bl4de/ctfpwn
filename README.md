## ctfpwn

Framework for making CTFs, bug bounty and pentesting Python scripting easier

### what

Most common tasks found while writing Python scripts during CTFs, bug bounty hunting, solving crackmes, hackmes and vulnerable VMs. Think of: hashing strings, encoding/decoding strings, Base64-ing, dictionary attacks against hashes etc.

### why

Because I found I write the same things all the time and never remember I've already did them earlier.
Also, for learn some new Python skills. And for fun. And because I want to, and I can :)

But mostly because of very first reason - to not repeat myself in every CTF

### where

Here (GitHub) and as Python package installable via pip

### who

Me. But if you want to send PR, feel free to do so
